To add:

 * Reason for not centering on visit (history at ASRI)
 * history of DB evolution
 * comparison with ASRI and BBDB: matrix with tables as rows and 3 cols
 * `diff` of schemas for ASRI and BBDB.
 * Run schemaspy on ASRI and BBDB.
 * Explain the pharmacy... too complex, but... needed.
 * Data cleaning (explain, not enough checks of e.g. dates, and too
   much permission for users to create duplicate records)
